# 120 Years of Olympics – Data Analysis

A **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project** implemented in **Python**, analyzing athlete participation, medal trends, and sports diversity across 120years of olympics

---

## Overview
This project implements an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on historical Olympic data spanning more than a century.  
The analysis focuses on athlete demographics, medal distributions, country-wise performance, sport-wise trends, and gender participation over time.  
A structured EDA workflow is followed to extract meaningful insights from real-world sports data.

## Core Features
- Data loading and cleaning  
- Statistical analysis of athlete ages (average and range)  
- Identification of unique sports, events, and participating countries  
- Medal count analysis by country, sport, and year  
- Athlete-level performance analysis  
- Gender participation trend analysis  
- Visualization of participation and medal trends  

---

## Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries Used:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Execution Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Application Mechanics
- Data is loaded and cleaned using **Pandas**  
- Numerical analysis is performed using **NumPy**  
- Grouping, filtering, and aggregation techniques are applied  
- Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- The analysis answers the following questions:
  - Average and range of athlete ages  
  - Number of unique sports, events, and countries  
  - Medal counts grouped by country, sport, and year  
  - Athlete with the most medals  
  - Gender participation over time  
  - Athlete participation over the years  
  - Countries and sports with the most medals
